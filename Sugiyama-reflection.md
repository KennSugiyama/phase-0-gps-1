# REFLECTION

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* The git workflow is much more clearer.  
* The workflow for dealing with merge conflicts.
* The practice of mergining the master into the secondary branch, then push to gitHub, and once the merge has been accepted, pull the gitHub master to your lcoal master.

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I was confused why if a change was saved onto a non-master branch, then why was the changes showing up on the file located on the master branch.  I now undertand that files must first be commited.  After that, the files on the branches will show the changes.

## What still confuses you about Git?
I feel like I have understand the general concepts, and now I need to strengthen my understanding by practicing.

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Great!  I was the only student, so it was awesome to get all of Kit's attention to help me through this exercise.
